				<p>To Victor Emmanuel <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, King of Italy.</p>

			<p>Sire,</p>
			<p>In dedicating this volume to your Majesty, I am also doing an act of justice to the memory of your illustrious father.</p>
			<p>In 1840, the King, Charles Albert, invited the learned of Italy to assemble in his capital. At the request of her most gifted Analyst, I brought with me the drawings and explanations of the Analytical Engine. These were thoroughly examined and their truth acknowledged by Italy’s choicest sons.</p>
			<p>To the King, your father, I am indebted for the first public and official acknowledgment of this invention.</p>
			<p>I am happy in thus expressing my deep sense of that obligation to his son, the Sovereign of united Italy, the country of Archimedes and of Galileo.</p>
